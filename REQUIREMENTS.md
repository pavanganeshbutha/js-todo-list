# 📋 Project Requirements: Vanilla JS TODO List

This document defines the core functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the JavaScript TODO List application.

## I. Functional Requirements (What the app MUST do)

1.  **Task Creation (CRUD - Create):** Users must be able to input text and submit a new task to the list.
2.  **Task Viewing (CRUD - Read):** All submitted tasks must be displayed in a visible list format.
3.  **Task Completion (CRUD - Update):** Users must be able to click on a task to toggle its completion status (e.g., adding a strikethrough style).
4.  **Task Deletion (CRUD - Delete):** Each task item must have an accessible button or control to permanently remove it from the list.
5.  **Data Persistence:** The list of tasks (including their completion status) must be saved locally using the **Browser's Local Storage** so that they remain visible after the user closes and reopens the browser or refreshes the page.

## II. Non-Functional Requirements (How the app MUST be)

1.  **Technology Stack:** Must be built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** (no external frameworks or libraries).
2.  **User Interface (UI):** The design must be clean, simple, and intuitive.
3.  **Responsiveness:** The application layout must adapt cleanly for use on both **desktop and mobile** screens.

## III. Stretch Goals (Optional, Post-MVP)

1.  **Task Editing:** Allow users to modify the text of an existing task.
2.  **Filtering:** Implement buttons to show "All," "Active," or "Completed" tasks.
